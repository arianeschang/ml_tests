README FOR SELF IMPLEMENTED NEURAL NETWORK
Files: project3_hyperparameter_tuning.py
		project3_my_nn.py

To run the neural network, you need to use the project3_hyperparameter_tuning file. This will call the
neural network from inside the other file, which has all the necessary methods. 

Lines numbers 47-51 can be un-commented in order to read the data from the original files (please place these
in the project directory), use the SIFT algorithm and then be pickled for future use without having to 
re-vectorize all the photos. 

If you would like to run the whole grid search for hyperparameter tuning, you may simply un-comment lines
59 to 109. Otherwise, it runs the algorithm with the best version of the algorithm found.
